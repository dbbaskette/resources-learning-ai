# Resource for Learning Spring
I was inspired by DaShaun Carter and Dan Vega and their Resources for Learning Spring Repo (https://github.com/spring-office-hours/resources-learning-spring) to build the same typpe repo for AI.  I am trying to learn a bit deeper, and this site will list the resources I find most valuable.
